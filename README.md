# pretest

* Please complete this test by September 18. I will use the results to better calibrate the course to student background.
* Don't spend more than 1 hour.
* Don't consult outside resources. The goal is to see what you know, not what you can find answers to. (Looking up the definition of a term you've heard before is fine, but try to stick to the spirit of the test. Use your best judgment.)
* This is graded, on completion only (full points if submitted, none if not).
