# Preclass assignment

* Please download the `pretest.pdf` file and complete it by September 24 at 9am. I will use the results to better calibrate the course to student background. Email your answers to <daniel.mcdonald@chicagobooth.edu>.
* Don't spend more than 1 hour.
* Don't consult outside resources. The goal is to see what you know, not what you can find answers to. (Looking up the definition of a term you've heard before is fine, but try to stick to the spirit of the test. Use your best judgment.)
* This is graded, on completion only (full points if submitted, none if not).
